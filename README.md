# Setup and Installation Instructions


First run `git clone https://github.com/Intro-to-SE-Spring-21/Group5repo.git`


On Windows:
Install wampserver -- https://www.wampserver.com/en/

On Mac:
Install mampserver -- https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/
You'll have to figure out the specifics for this program, but it's probably similar

On Linux:
your on linux, you already know


Next Follow this guide:  https://duvien.com/blog/setting-local-development-server-wamp-windows-10

Confirm that you can login and access phpMyAdmin.

From phpMyAdmin, login to the root user and run the query provided in database_setupQueries.txt
This will create the blank tables our website uses to store data for posts, users, and other data


Now following the WAMP setup guide, move our project directory into the appropriate folder so WAMP can find it.

Create a virtualhost for the website, then open it up in the browser
